# Smart Bin

## Project Overview
The **Smart Bin** project addresses modern waste management challenges by incorporating IoT technologies, sensors, and mechanical systems. The smart bin detects garbage levels, compresses waste at the source, and sends real-time notifications when full. By optimizing waste collection schedules and reducing the frequency of emptying bins, the system aims to enhance cleanliness and operational efficiency while promoting eco-friendly practices.

## Key Features
- **Garbage Level Detection:** Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to monitor the fill level.
- **Automated Compression:** Saves space by compressing garbage directly in the bin.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Sends SMS notifications to the concerned authorities when the bin is full using a GSM module.
- **Cost Optimization:** Reduces waste collection trips and emissions from garbage trucks.
- **Smart City Integration:** Ideal for implementation in smart buildings, hospitals, colleges, and bus stands.
